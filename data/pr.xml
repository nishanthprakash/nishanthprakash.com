These are some of the projects I worked on at NITK, Surathkal. Contact me through email if you need more information on any of these and/or if you would like to work with me on AI/Machine Learning/Data Science projects. I would be more than enthusiastic to work on open source projects in these fields especially if its something related to augmenting the human physical/mental conditions like building gadgets for the physically/mentally challenged, etc.
