<span class="firstcharacter">S</span>ome of my other interests: I enjoy studying art, music, literature and psychology; especially the exploration of the symmetry that "miraculously" exists between mathematics and nature <sup>[1]</sup> through my research and studies. Here is a quote that almost describes my fascination with mathematics:
<br/>
<blockquote align="justify"><i>
&quot;Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty, a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry.&quot;

Needless to say I love computer programming. Here is another quote that describes my fascination with programming:
<br/>
<blockquote align="justify"><i>
&quot;The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures. ... Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms. The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time.&quot;

I love reading - fiction, non-fiction, short stories, comic strips, research papers, etc. Some authors I have liked reading are <i>Aldous Huxley, Douglas Hofstadter, compilations by John Brockman, Robert Anton Wilson, Jonathan Safran Foer, Marshall McLuhan, Kurt Vonnegut, Thomas Pynchon, Samuel Beckett, Charles Bukowski, Flann O'Brien (Brian O'Nolan), Neal Stephenson, Vladimir Nabokov, Mark Twain, Douglas Adams, J.K. Rowling (Harry Potter series), David Foster Wallace, Franz Kafka, Isaac Asimov, Virginia Woolf, John Updike, Chuck Palahnuik, Philip K Dick, Amy Hempel, etc.</i> <br/><br/>I am also often found noodling on my guitar; I record improvisations when I feel very motivated (Check out <a style="all:unset; color:#0000FF;" onmouseover="this.style.textDecoration='underline'; this.style.color='red';" onmouseout="this.style.textDecoration='none'; this.style.color='blue';" href="javascript:makeGetRequest('mu')">my music page</a> on the reflections tab). I enjoy listening to music - classic rock, neoclassical metal, post rock, Indian and Western classical and jazz music; and am an ardent fan of <i>Jason Becker, Steve Vai, Paul Gilbert, Joe Satriani, Dream Theater, Liquid Tension Experiment, John5, Buckethead, Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, Guns N Roses, Django Reindhardt, King Crimson, Porcupine Tree, Opeth, Kiko Loureiro, Angel Vivaldi, Tesseract, Tool, John McLaughlin, Bhimsen Joshi etc.</i><br/><br/> I also enjoy hiking and travelling; and love playing chess, squash, badminton, pool and Age of Empires.

One other quote that resonates strongly with me:
<br/>
<blockquote align="justify"><i>
&quot;A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.&quot;
