<span class="firstcharacter">H</span>ello World! I'm Nishanth Prakash, a graduate student studying Computer Science at Brown University. 

<!--I graduated from National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal (NITK/KREC), with a BTech. degree in Computer Engineering in 2013. I then worked as a Software Developer at Netapp and then as a Research and Development Engineer at Aspiring Minds, about one year at each. I was a Visiting Research Scholar at the Hasso Plattner Institut, Potsdam, Germany, in the summer of 2016. <br/> <br/> 

My core research focus is in the deconstruction of human intelligence and cognition into mathematical constructs. I believe that this not only enables the understanding of the biological process of learning but also reciprocally helps build biologically inspired artificial intelligent agents that can augment human abilities, overcome disabilities, improve human learning and cognition (resulting in effective education) and assist in the everlasting human enterprise of understanding the world.<br/><br/>

Currently, I am focused on classifying/clustering the different programming plans that students use to compose their programs and solve particular problems.--> Over the last few years, I have developed a passion for Programming Languages and Machine Learning, and am interested in exploring the intersection of these fields, <!--such as in Computer-Aided Program Synthesis and Software Engineering.<br/> <br/>-->
