Every morn the day wakes into its life, waking all life into it. 
And as darkness blots up the sky we slumber and wake into our dreams. 
In this linear variation of events, zillions of other random events lie sprawled across time. 
Each moment elusively conceiving another moment of an event, 
each of its infinite dimensions smeared with beauty before their exhibition upon our eyes.    
And we, somewhere amid these events, in search of free will from within reason and 
in search of patterns to explain reason are left wondering about it all.
<br/>Hi, I'm Nishanth Prakash and this is a website to share my wonderment as I attempt to see the infinitude in each of the moments I live.
