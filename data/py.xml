As part of the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/research/plt/">Brown University Programming Languages Team</a>, I have contributed to the Pyret programming language in the form of minor bug fixes.<br/>
<br/>
Pyret is a programming language that combines the best of functional and scripting languages to create a language for teaching and, perhaps down the road, general-purpose programming. Pyret is an umbrella for several efforts in compilation, type systems, error-reporting, language design, and much more.<br/><br/>
