<span class="firstcharacter">I</span> enjoy exploring the spectrum of human emotions through improvising over their isomorphic patterns in musical notes. Here are some of my on-spot improvs I have recorded. I have not done any pre/post processing on them and is as recorded - raw. Hope you enjoy them; let me know what you think of them on Soundcloud. PM if you would like to collaborate/jam with me.<br/>

&quot;... And that music is so powerful that it's quite beyond my control and ah<br/>
When I'm in the grips of it I don't feel pleasure and I don't feel pain, either physically or emotionally<br/>
Do you understand what I'm talking about?<br/>
Have you ever felt like that?<br/>
When you just couldn't feel anything and you didn't want to either<br/>
You know? Like that? Do you understand what I'm saying sir?&quot;
