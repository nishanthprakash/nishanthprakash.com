This was the Major Project I worked on in my final year at NITK. Developed an autonomic resource management framework for virtualization based data centres which helps in optimum utilization of resources. Allocation of CPU resources to guest operating systems, was done by predicting the workload demands using various statistical learning methods proactively & reactively, thus reducing response time and optimally improving utilization of resources. Also, a software module for a general revenue/pricing model is developed which optimizes profit against penalties incurred depending on predicted requests, respective allocations and certain service level agreements. Various proactive and reactive prediction systems were developed with an additional chaos indicator module that switched between noisy and noiseless prediction systems based on the non-linearity of the load. It was tested on a 3-tier architecture using a load generator called Httperf on a web application called WebCalendar.
