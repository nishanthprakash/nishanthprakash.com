<span class="firstcharacter">I</span> greatly enjoy exploring the spectrum of human emotions through improvising over their isomorphic patterns in musical notes. Here are some of my on-spot impros I have recorded. I have not done any pre/post processing on them and is as recorded - raw. Hope you enjoy them. Also let me know what you think of them on Soundcloud. PM if you would like to collaborate with me in music projects or if you would simply like to jam with me in leisure or at a gig.<br/><br/>
