<h2 class="margined">Quantification of grace in human body movements using fractal analysis</h2>
<p align="justify" class="margined">As part of this project I investigated the application of fractal analysis in quantification of grace and consistency in human body movements under the guidance of Prof. S N Omkar, Chief Research Scientist at the Department of Aerospace Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. I worked on this project as part of my winter research internship at IISc in December, 2011. A statistical model to quantify grace and consistency of body movements was developed using data obtained from Inertial Magnetic Unit belt worn by the activity performers. The variogram estimator was used for the estimation of Fractal Dimensions, the inverse of which describes the smoothness of a time series graph and hence corresponds to a measure of grace of performance of a movement. Feedback to improve grace by localizing jerky movements in the time series, is also given using the instantaneous frequency measures obtained from Hilbert-Huang transformation of the performance data. The R programming language was used for computation. For more details on this please contact me.
