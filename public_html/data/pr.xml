<span class="firstcharacter">T</span>hese are some of the projects I worked on during my undergrad days at NITK, at NetApp where I worked as a Software Developer and at Aspiring Minds where I worked as a Research and Development Engineer. Please share your feedback on them and contact me through email if you need more information on any of these and/or if you would like to work with me on projects related to Machine Learning and AI. I would be more than enthusiastic to volunteer or contribute to open source projects in these fields; especially if its something related to building intelligent agents for overcoming human disabilities. My current research focus is in designing intelligent tutoring systems in the field of computer programming.
